# Applied_Bioinformatics_Assessment_task_4_Part2
part 2. Examining biological sequence diversity

in Applied Bioinformatics AT 4, part 2, the purpose of this script is to analyse and compare the genomic data of Corynebaterium Bovis and E coli. The coding sequences were first downloaded and then analysed and comapred in term sof sequene lengths. Then the second step, the total coding DNA was counted and and compared. in the third step, length of coding sequences were analysed for mean, median and placed in a boxplot. in the fourth step, nucleotides and amino acids were analysed and compared in terms of how much they are and compared.Next, the codon usage bias is calculated and compared and lastly, 10 proteins k mers were identified and analysed and comapred for both of them, whether or not these are over-represented or under-represented.s
